OTHELLO
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me; 		1
Lend me thy handkerchief. 				2

DESDEMONA
Here, my lord. 					3

OTHELLO
That which I gave you.				4

DESDEMONA
I have it not about me.				5

OTHELLO
Not?							6

DESDEMONA
No, indeed, my lord. 					7

OTHELLO
That is a fault. That handkerchief			8
Did an Egyptian to my mother give; 			9 
To lose't or give't away were such perdition 		10
As nothing else could match. 				11

DESDEMONA
Is't possible? 						12

OTHELLO
'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it. 		13

DESDEMONA
Then would to God that I had never seen't! 		14

OTHELLO
Ha! Wherefore? 					15

DESDEMONA
Why do you speak so startingly and rash? 		16

OTHELLO
Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way? 	17 

DESDEMONA
Heaven bless us! 					18

OTHELLO
Say you? 						19 

DESDEMONA
It is not lost; but what an if it were? 			20

OTHELLO
How! 							21

DESDEMONA
I say, it is not lost. 					22

OTHELLO
Fetch't, let me see't. 					23

DESDEMONA
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now. 			24
This is a trick to put me from my suit: 		25 
Pray you, let Cassio be received again. 		26

OTHELLO
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives. 	27

DESDEMONA
Come, come;						28
You'll never meet a more sufficient man. 		29

OTHELLO
The handkerchief!					30 

DESDEMONA						31
I pray, talk me of Cassio.				32

OTHELLO
The handkerchief! 					33

DESDEMONA
A man that all his time				34
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,	35
Shared dangers with you,--				36

OTHELLO
The handkerchief!					37

DESDEMONA
Iâ€™faith, you are to blame. 				38

OTHELLO
Zounds! 						39
